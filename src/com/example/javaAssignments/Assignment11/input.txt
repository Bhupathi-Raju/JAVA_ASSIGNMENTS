After a week of reports, Microsoft has confirmed its restructuring plans. As we previously reported, the moves are expected to impact thousands at the company as it works to reorganize its sales team. Subsequent numbers have put the headcount at anywhere between “up to 3,000”  to closer to 5,000. CNBC, which reported the smaller figure, adds that around three-quarters of the cuts will occur outside the U.S.

For its part, Microsoft is refusing to cite specific numbers just yet, only confirming that it began the process of informing employees of job losses today. Otherwise, the note provided to TechCrunch is a fairly lukewarm confirmation of layoffs that will most likely number in the thousands as previously reported.
